Technology has significantly improved various sectors, including agriculture, which is the backbone of our country. Despite these advancements, farmers today face serious economic challenges, mainly due to a lack of consistent employment opportunities. To address this issue, our system offers a platform where farmers can be hired on an hourly or daily basis, providing them with a stable source of income. It also introduces a flexible land management model with three options: sell, share, and hire. In the sell option, farmers who are unable to maintain their land can sell it through the platform. The share option allows investors to support cultivation financially in return for a share of the profits. The hire option enables farmers without land to rent farmland, cultivate crops, and pay rent based on mutual agreement. Beyond financial solutions, the system also aims to involve the general public by offering them the chance to experience farming activities firsthand. This not only helps people understand the hard work and challenges farmers face but also builds respect and support for the farming community. By connecting farmers with employment, land resources, and public engagement, the system works toward improving the livelihood of farmers and strengthening the agricultural sector as a whole.
